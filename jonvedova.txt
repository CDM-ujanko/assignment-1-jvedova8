Hey Professor Jankovic,

I am currently a junior at DePaul University studying Information Technology.  I enjoy listening to music and creating it
with friends when I have some free time.  I go to school full time and work Friday/Saturday and Sunday so that I can
afford to pay for my schooling as well as day-to-day living expenses.  I also enjoy playing soccer, volleyball and
disc golf or ultimate frisbee when I want to do something active competitively or recreationally with friends.
During the winter, I try to snowboard as much as I can since I started to learn snow sports at an early age while growing
up in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Excited to learn more about Javascript and JQuery this quarter!

Best,
Jon
